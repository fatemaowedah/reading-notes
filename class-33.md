#### answer the questions
- Why would a developer choose to make data models? to create standard way to store large amount of data and it give us  higher quality ,reduce the cost,build the software faster,clear the scope,Better documentation, less data errors

Mongoose is the package that MongoDB uses,it do the mange relations between data and delivery method between our application and our database. `node.js -> mongoose -> MongoDB`
- Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.For an apparel brand: Clothing, Accessories, and Hats. Clothing would be in a separate data pool than the other two. Accessories would be adjacent to Clothing. And Hats would fall under Accessories. Perhaps Accessories could fall under Clothing as well but in my head, they are different enough that they should be separate categories of item.
