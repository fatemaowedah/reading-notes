#### answer the questions
- Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development?
reduce the time in rework, less time in debugg the code and it is improve the quality.
- In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
beforeEach() & afterEach()handle asynchronous code, allow us to define setup which are execute at the end and the begin of every blocks we use it because it is helpfull and help us because it decrease the code in test script.
- What is one downside of Test Driven Development?Sometimes the design is not clear at the start and evolves as you go along.
- Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?A class is a type of function,we use the keyword class, and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.
- Name a use case for a static method?we can define it in class and we cant call static method on class.
- Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves?Array.prototype.filter it is h igher order function is afunction recived a function as argument for filter or return return new array without change the original array.

#### Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- functional programming: this mean  the process of building software using pure function as you built app with javascript only.
- Pure functions: type of function in all time give the same output and input , it don't have side effect.
- higher-order function: type of function take function as arguments or return function.
- immutable state: state cannot be changed like immutable object we can modified after it.
- object: collection of related data it had form as `Key:value`
- object-oriented programming (OOP): computer programming which organized software design around data.
- class: type of function we declare it by `class` and the property asign as constructor().
- super: we use it to access and call function on object parent.
- inheritance: prototype object supported it .
- constructor: function that creates an instance of a class.
- this: refers to the object it belongs to.
- Test Driven Development (TDD): aproach first create test which specifies and validates before write the code it help us to make the code simple and clear.
- Jest:Test Framework focus on simplicity.
- Continuous Integration (CI):is the practice that integrat code changes from multiple contributors into software project.
- unit test:software testing individual units/ components.

#### Document the following Vocabulary Terms
##### TDD in JS
at the first time the code take a lot of time after that take less than because we generize the code and make it simple`learn simplyify simplyfiy` you must built maintainable code 
##### javascript context
it is the value of this `context === this` it maybe be context is the window or object if you need to change the context use call or apply it accebt more that one arrugement or bind accept one arrugement.
