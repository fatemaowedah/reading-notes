### Props and State
#### Forms and Inputs
react input is stateful child components, we must manage the state of inputs through own stateful component, it have props and each input has onChange event we can handle and use update our form-container's state each time the user interacts with an input.
#### Props
it is Components accept arbitrary inputs, props are passed into a component with a syntax that look like HTML attributes, it is equivalent of function params, prop is the an object passed into a component constructor and we can access it by using props, props is a property of constructor in super function we use it by avariable contest by `this.prop`, prop can be data or function, we can pass function (call back) like a variables.
#### One Way Data flow
state ca passed from parent component through props it is the idea if data flow this data flow passed down the component tree if you want to pass a data to a parent this function pass to child.
#### setState explained
state can be anything it is a way to update state after the initial state setup, we pass an object to setState() this object contain the part of state we update setState()response with answer, react create a tree contain the element and compare the element in this tree with the previous tree,we use setState() to change state. Modifying state, we can pass function to setState(), we can use object.assign to copy data from a source object to a target object, we can access the previous state by `this.state`, there is something called wrapping up it work with setState() it update a components it pass ibject or function we pass the function when we change the state more than one not depend on this.stat.
#### Handling Events 
we named react event using camelCase JSX you pass a function as the event handler not as string, it cant return false to prevent default behavior in react, synthetic events according to the W3C spec,Toggle component renders a button that lets the user toggle between ON and OFF states, we can pass an argument to Event Handlers we can pass an extra parameter to an event.
#### forms
when the user submit the formwe have a javascript sunction that handles the submission of the form and have access to the data that the user enter in the form we call it controlled components, it is a form element like: input, textarea, select, maintain own state and update it based on user input, we can update it by using `setState()` the value we put it in the form element we can access it by this.state.value input value driven by react state it have a type textarea, select, input, there is alternative to controle component use  uncontrolled components.
#### State and Lifecycle
when we want to update  the UI w use `ReactDOM.render()` we use it to change render output,the Clock sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the Clock, we convert function to class by create ES6 function extend the react.component, add empty method render(), move the body of the function to render()body, replace prop with this.prop finally delete empty function, the render wull called each time an update happen, we can add local state to class, we can add lifecycle method to a class use ` set up a timer` to render dom for first time and clear that timer where the dom produce to clock.
#### components and props
accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen, function and class components it accept prop we use ES6 class to define component, two components are equivalent from React’s point of view, we can do Composing Components,components in their output, we can extract compnent to smaller components it accept authir an object ot text string we can made Props are Read-Only, declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props.
