### Component Composition
#### Routing
use react-router it help us to toggle the visibility of components based on URL/Route, you can put route in link component.
#### react basics recap
The Component Lifecycle: in the lifecycle of component starts mounting and moves onto updating, until removed it from the virtual DOM, after that unmounting phase and gets removed from the DOM, this lifecycle help us run code at specific points, in the lifecycle we have the mounting: the constructor the first methods run it initialize component state, after that it run getDerivedStateFromProps, there is render method return JSX, at the last componentDidMount method run, update: this happen in every time state or props changes we use ComponentUpdate to compare old props/state with the nes set of prop/state, hould re-render or not by returning true or false, app more efficient. Unmounting: ast stage of the component lifecycle. When you remove a component from the DOM, React runs componentWillUnmount. there is something call higher-order components it is helpful because let us reuse code and remove bloat, React State and setState(), React Context:llows you to create global context objects that can be given to any component you make. This allows you to share data without having to pass props down all the way through the DOM tree.
#### props.children
we use it to display anything between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component, we can invoke it  with a self-closing tag, if you invoke it will be opening and closing tags you can then place more code between it, and it make it more reusable, the veru important feature of props.children it may be anything, help us to customize app’s content while still being able to reuse the same components.
#### browser router tutorial
React Router v4 is a pure React rewrite of the popular React package,there is 3 package in react-router : react-router, react-router-dom, and react-router-native, in the first time you should type of router BrowserRouter: used when you have a server that will handle dynamic requests, HashRouter:used for static websites where the server can only respond to requests for files that it knows about, in each time you create an router it create history object: to keep track of the current location and re-render the website whenever that changes, Rendering a Router: it accept single child element for that create app component render application and this app have header and main, routes expectes path prop tring that describes the pathname that the route matches, to match path use path-to-regexp, use switch to group of routes, route render component, render, children, you can use nested route.
#### composition vs inheritance
the best way every component use the special children prop to pass children elemetns, we can pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX, some off react element are just object like chat you can pass them as props like another data, there is something call special cases achieved by composition, Props and composition give us flexibility to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way.
#### browser router api docs
when you want to use hooks you must have react more than 16.8 there is hooks like useHistory: we use it to access to the history instance that you may use to navigate, useLocation
: returns the location object it is helpful incase if you want to trigger a new “page view” event using your web analytics tool whenever a new page loads,useParams: returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters. Use it to access match.params of the current, useRouteMatch: to match the current URL in the same way that Route would, we use `BrowserRouter` to keep your UI in sync with the URL, it have basename: string, getUserConfirmation: func, forceRefresh: bool, keyLength: number, children: node, but `HashRouter`:to keep your UI in sync with the URL, it have basename: string, getUserConfirmation: func, hashType: string, children: node, `Link `: Provides declarative, accessible navigation around your application, it have to: string, to: object, to: function, replace: bool, innerRef: function, innerRef: RefObject, component: React.Component.
