###  Custom Hooks
####  Custom Hooks
Extract duplicated logic from components, Share common functionality, Take advantage of useEffect lifecycle
, Handle forms easily, Pre-fetch API data, Connect to service, Hooks are exported as a function, named as use, Hooks return data or behaviors (functions) that are required to reuse their internal functionality, Hooks are imported into components,Components can re-use the hook functionality or data/state as needed, Hooks do not render. 
####  custom hooks - all you need to know
Hooks are just functions, Creating a Custom Hook: JavaScript functions whose names are prefixed with the word use,  is a normal function but we hold them to a different standard,Hook is a special function that lets you hook into React features, it is allow us to create and manage state in functional component, hooks are javascript function, we name it by using `use` only call hooks at the top level, Only call Hooks from React function components,Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions, built in hooks use `useState()` it return state variable like `clicks` and setterFunction like `setClicks`, it work by convention (set + statevariable) to be function name, useState() takes a single param, you can call it like `setClicks(7)` .
####  useReducer Hook
An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method, two different ways to initialize useReducer state. You may choose either one depending on the use case. The simplest way is to pass the initial state as a second argument, create the initial state lazily. To do this, you can pass an init function as the third argument, If you return the same value from a Reducer Hook as the current state, React will bail out without rendering the children, useRef:returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument, useImperativeHandle:customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref, useLayoutEffect: The signature is identical to useEffect, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations, useDebugValue:an be used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.
####  react custom hooks
lets you extract component logic into reusable functions, we’ve had two popular ways to share stateful logic between components: render props and higher-order components, Hooks solve many of the same problems without forcing you to add more components to the tree, Extracting a Custom Hook: share logic between two JavaScript functions, we extract it to a third function, A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with (use) and that may call other Hooks, Using a Custom Hook: convention that naturally follows from the design of Hooks, rather than a React feature, it start with use, two components using the same Hook share state.
####  use hooks
Hooks are a new addition in React that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class, useMemoCompare: pass a custom compare function that gets both the previous and new value, The compare function can then compare nested properties, useAsync:fetching data from an API and displaying a loading indicator before rendering the results,useRequireAuth:  redirect the user if they are signed out and trying to view a page that should require them to be authenticated, useRouter: exposes just the data and methods we need, ompose multiple hooks and combine their returned state into a single object, useAuth:enables any component to get the current auth state and re-render if it changes,useEventListener: supported, adding the event listener, and removal on cleanup,useLockBodyScroll:prevent your users from being able to scroll the body of your page while a particular component is absolutely positioned over your page.
####  10 React Hooks you Should Have in Your Toolbox
