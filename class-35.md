### Linked Lists
*it is a data structure which is sequance of node that have relation to each other, **there is type** of by the reference it single(next ref), double(next and prev), head(type of type),current(type of type)*
when we say **node** it is the item of the linked test, if you want 
##### Traversal
*when we need to traversing it we use `Next` it is important it help us to next node **and** we can use `while()`the benifit of it is contininually check next 
##### Prerequisites
- when you create a node you must give it a value.
- put the first node us ahead and the current us a current.
 ### What’s a Linked List
 *the first thing it will encounter you is the data structure we can organized by variables, arrays, hashes, objects and there is something called `linked lists` , there is type of data structure such as linear(it be arranged by order if we want to traverse it you will be in sequance)and non-linear data structures(opposite of linear).*
 ##### Memory management
 *there is alot of things make the linked list powerful **memory allocation don’t need to take up a single block of memory and it is dynamic data** not like the array when you use it we do not think in the memory of tha machine because it need a continuos block of memory and it is static data*
 ##### Parts of a linked list
 *there is part of it such as head(entry point to the list),  series of node(contain of data and ref to next node) ,null(end of the list),*
 ##### Lists for all shapes and sizes
 *there is different type of linked test: **single** it have a next ref, **double** it have next and pre, **dircular** acts as the tail of the list*
 ##### what even is Big O?
 *a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm it consider about efficiency and tradeoffs, there is two type of bigO: **time** time that an algorithm takes to run, **space** how mush space take from memory.*
 ##### Growing a linked list
 *the linked in work as array you can add element and remove it but it differnt about array in memory allocation as we say linked list contain of node this node have data and pointer to next node or null, we start by head node the follow next until reach null*
