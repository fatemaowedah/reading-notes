### Solve Programming Problems
#### Common mistake 
there is a common mistake the coder do it when they solve the problem as: they try to solve the problem without understand the problem  in clear way they open the vs code and start write the code the code will be complicated because they think they can solve it from the first time, we must understand the problem.
#### Step for Solving problem:
**You Must have a confidence and practice the step**
*there is a step can help you to solve the problem*
* Read the problem mmore than one time : *every time you read the problem you can understand the problem butter for that take your time in it because if you understand the prolem tou can think in good way. if you face complicated problem dont be fraid use `divide and conquer` method*
* Solve the problem manually: *when you have problem solving use paper and pen try to do a process help you in solve it when you write the process your think help you*
* Optimize the manual steps. *optimize good because there is a lot of way to do things search about the simpility*
* Write the manual steps as comments.*this step help you to do not forgit the process because when you face a problem you have a blockminde it will help you and direction you*
* Replace the comments with real code.*Know you can write the code in vs it will be easy because you do the previous step in good way*
* Optimize the real code.*the most important for coder it make the code readable and simple*
### Act like you make $1000/hr
*every one in this life have goals and dream to achive them but there is alot thing face him the method it is good before you start doing in your day you must have a do list and think in this list in what it helpful and will give me butter thing maybe learning ow something like that this method will help you to be focused and effective and be more productive and do not feel stress because it is effect in bad way think in the to do list which plan in toDo list worth 1.000/hour it is prioitize it not about mony it about after the ennd of day what you complete, you can do alot of amazing things for that you must organized your time because if you invested your time in good way you will be butter person.*

### How to think like a programmer:

*the best way to solving problem is to be **Organized** i will tell you why because the the solution it not coming from the sky you must have paper and pen and drow the framework it help you to understand the problem after that plan how to solve it and as i say if the problem is big and complicated you must divide it to parts and think in individual part and every time you feel you are stuck the best way is debuging the code in every time you practice you will improve your solving problem skill*
