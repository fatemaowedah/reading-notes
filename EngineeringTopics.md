## Engineering Topics
### Solve Programming Problems
#### Common mistake 
* trying to solve the problem without understand it in clear way.
* trying to solve the problem on the first iteration.Keep it simple.
#### Step for Solving problem:
* Read the problem completely twice: *make sure you completely understand the problem.*
* Solve the problem manually: *there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.*
* Optimize the manual steps. *optimize the actual solution or simplify it*
* Write the manual steps as comments.
* Replace the comments with real code.
* Optimize the real code.
* having confidence in this process, is to practice it.
* `divide and conquer`complicated problem, try and find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process

### Act like you make $1000/hr
* Youâ€™d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.
* Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy.
* Take stock of the things you did this week. How many of them were worthy of $1,000/hour?
* You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them.

### How to think like a programmer:
* Problem solving is the meta-skill.
* the best way to solve problem:
  * having a framework.
    * Understand
    * Plan
    * Divide
    * Stuck?(Debug)
  * practicing it.
