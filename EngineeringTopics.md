### Solve Programming Problems
#### Common mistake 
* trying to solve the problem without understand it in clear way.
* trying to solve the problem on the first iteration.Keep it simple.
#### Step for Solving problem:
* Read the problem completely twice: *make sure you completely understand the problem.*
* Solve the problem manually: *there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.*
* Optimize the manual steps. *optimize the actual solution or simplify it*
* Write the manual steps as comments.
* Replace the comments with real code.
* Optimize the real code.
* having confidence in this process, is to practice it.
* `divide and conquer`complicated problem, try and find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process
