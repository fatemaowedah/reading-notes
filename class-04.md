## Layout:
each element in html have it own box :this box will either be:
* Block-level Elements: *start on a new line*
* Inline Elements: *flow in between surrounding text*
* box may be nested inside several other block-level-elements,the containing elements is always the direct parent of the elements.
 ### Containing the position of Elements:
 * positioning schemes: *Normal flow, Relative Positioning, absolute positioning,fixed .*
 * when you use positions you may need to use *box offset:* fixed,floatting elements.
 * position : *static, relative, absolute,fixed*
 * overlapping Element use `z-index`
 * learing Float : `clear` left, right, both, none.

 # JavaScript:
 ## Function , Methods & object 
 * **Functions** let you group series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function .

* To declaring a function, give it a name and write the code needed to be executed inside the curly braaces.`function sayHello(){document.write('Hello!')};`

* To call a function you write the function name followed by peranthasis, it should look like `sayHello();`

* Some functions need (parameters) we put it inside the paranthesis,  `function getArea(width, height){return width * height;}`
`(width and height)` are the parameters.

* To call a function have parameters, we replace the parameters with values to be put in the function, `getArea(3,5)`

* Some functions return an output when we call them, a returns the result of adding naumbers, returns more than value using area .
