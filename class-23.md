## SQL
* tructured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.
* collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.
* SELECT queries 101 :To retrieve data from a SQL database,A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for,
* Queries with constraints :use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.
* WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching.
* Filtering and sorting Query results :though the data in a database may be unique`DISTINCT`
* OUTER JOINs:LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN or FULL JOIN
* Queries with expressions:se expressions to write more complex logic on column values in a query.
* Queries with aggregates:adding an additional HAVING clause which is used specifically with the GROUP BY clause to allow us to filter grouped rows from the result set.
* Inserting rows:use an INSERT statement.
* Updating rows:using an UPDATE statement
* Deleting rows: you can use a DELETE statement
* Creating tables:using the CREATE TABLE statement.
* Altering tables:sing the ALTER TABLE statement to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints.
* Dropping tables:you can use the DROP TABLE statement.
