### Hooks API
#### Hooks
Hooks is a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class, Hook is a special function that lets you hook into React features, it is allow us to create and manage state in functional component, hooks are javascript function, we name it by using `use` only call hooks at the top level, Only call Hooks from React function components,Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions, built in hooks use `useState()` it return state variable like `clicks` and setterFunction like `setClicks`, it work by convention (set + statevariable) to be function name, useState() takes a single param, you can call it like `setClicks(7)` . 
#### Using the State Hook
we have the ability to use function components, Hooks don’t work inside classes. But you can use them instead of writing classes, Hooks is a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class, Hook is a special function that lets you hook into React features, lets you add React state to function component we can use it If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, In a function component, we have no this if you want to read or assign this.state you can use `useState`, this build in method declares a state variable, it look like this.state, the arguement of useState() Hook is the initial state, it maybe object or string or a number, If you  wanted to store two different values in state, we would call useState() twice, and this method will return a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it.
#### Hooks at a Glance
effect Hook `useEffect`adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component when you call it you’re telling React to run your effect function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its props and state, there is a rules of hooks are JavaScript functions Only call Hooks at the top level: Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions, Only call Hooks from React function components,  Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions, for that provide a linter plugin to enforce these rules automatically. We understand these rules might seem limiting or confusing at first, but they are essential to making Hooks work well, you can build you own hooks by: higher-order components and render props, Custom Hooks help you without adding more components to your tree, we can use built-in Hooks, Like: `useContext` you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting, `useReducer`manage local state of complex components with a reducer.
#### Hooks API Reference
`useState` Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it, `setState`function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component, Functional updates use setState. The function will receive the previous value, and return an updated value,initialState argument is the state used during the initial render, If you update a State Hook to the same value as the current state, React will bail out without rendering the children or firing effects, React may still need to render that specific component again before bailing out, useEffect it accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code, he function passed to useEffect will run after the render is committed to the screen, clean-up function runs before the component is removed from the UI to prevent memory leaks, `useLayoutEffect` updates scheduled flushed synchronously, before the browser has a chance to paint,`useDebugValue` used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools accepts a formatting function as an optional second parameter. 
#### Using the Effect Hook
let us perform side effects in function components, There are two common kinds of side effects in React components: those that don’t require cleanup, and some of them need, Effects Without Cleanup: we want to run some additional code after React has updated the DOM, `useEffect` tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed and call it later after performing the DOM updates, we put it inside the component we can access the state variable, it runs both after the first render and after every update. Effects with Cleanup: Every effect may return a function that cleans up after it. This lets us keep the logic for adding and removing subscriptions close to each other, React also cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time,`useEffect` Hook API, it can tell React to skip applying an effect if certain values haven’t changed between re-renders.
