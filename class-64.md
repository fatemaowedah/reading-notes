###  React Native
####  react native basics
like React, uses native components instead of web components as building blocks, it have JSX, components, state, and props, need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components,import React to be able to use JSX, which will then be transformed to the native components of each platform, import the Text and View components from react-native, Props: make a single component that is used in many different places in your app, State: the state allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, the props are the variables that we pass from a parent component to a child component,  the state are also variables, with the difference that they are not passed as parameters.
####  expo
Expo tools, services, and React, you can build, deploy, and quickly iterate on native Android, iOS, and web apps from the same JavaScript codebase, Access to device capabilities like camera, location, notifications, sensors, haptics, and much more, all with universal APIs, Build service gives you app-store ready binaries and handles certificates, no need for you to touch Xcode or Android Studio, Over-the-air updates let you update your app at any time without the hassle and delays of submitting to the store. 
####  ejecting
ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project, Expo apps are written in pure JS and never "drop down" to the native iOS or Android layer, Expo allows you to eject your pure-JS project from the Expo iOS/Android clients, providing you with native projects that can be opened and built with Xcode and Android Studio, call this "ejecting" because you still depend on the Expo SDK, but your project no longer lives inside the standard Expo client, Your Expo project needs a native module that Expo doesn't currently support, need is to distribute your app in the iTunes Store or Google Play. Expo can build binaries for you in that case, Ejected apps will require you to manage Xcode and Android Studio projects, Expo no longer manages your push credentials, you'll need to manage your own push notification pipeline.
