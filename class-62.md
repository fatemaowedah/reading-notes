###  Redux - Asynchronous Actions
####  Thunking for Data
Redux actions to connect to remote APIs by Thunk Middleware,  need your actions to do some asynchronous action before you dispatch it to the reducer, Redux expects and requires, Redux expects and requires, implement thunk, inspects every dispatched action and then either lets it go through, processes the function and then dispatches what that function returns, middleware is implemented as a curried function that ultimately evaluates the action and determines whether it’s a function.
####  async actions
an asynchronous API, usually require a change in the application state; to do that, you need to dispatch normal actions that will be processed by reducers synchronously, there is different kinds of actions: An action informing the reducers that the request began, An action informing the reducers that the request finished successfully, An action informing the reducers that the request failed, actions governed by the user interaction, governed by the network requests, it is important to separate from SELECT_SUBREDDIT or INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT, may occur one after another,We store each subreddit's information separately so we can cache every subreddit, you'll want to store isFetching to show a spinner, if we want to dispatching actions together with network requests, we will write the reducers for the actions, Thunk middleware isn't the only way to orchestrate asynchronous actions in Redux you can use  redux-promise or redux-promise-middleware, redux-observable, redux-saga, redux-pack.  
####  Thunk middleware 
isn't the only way to orchestrate asynchronous actions in Redux, you can install it by npm install redux-thunk, we use it to: Dispatching Redux Actions with a Timeout, we need middleware for async flow in Redux, ets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object, receives the store’s dispatch method, communicating asynchronously with an external API to retrieve or save data, it easy to dispatch actions that follow the lifecycle of a request to an external API, receiving the dispatch method from the state, the function returned by an asynchronous action creator with Redux Thunk also receives the store’s getState method.
####  suspense
Async Rendering in React, to help with handling async operations respectively in regard to CPU power and data fetching, allows you to defer rendering part of your application tree until some condition is met, used to ensure good UX for apps that are fetching data from external sources, In the render() method, read a value from the cache,If the value is already cached, the render continues like normal, If the value is not already cached, the cache throws an error, When the promise resolves, React continues from where it stopped.
