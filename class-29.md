## Dtabase Normalization:
*a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.*
* The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic.
* only supporting topics included.
* By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database.
### Reasons for Database Normalization
* minimize duplicate data.
* minimize or avoid data modification issues.
* simplify queries. 
### Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies
* It increases storage and decrease performance.
* It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.
### Insert Anomaly
*we need provide a primary key.*
### Definition of Database Normalization
*The forms are progressive*
* First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. 
* Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
* Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
