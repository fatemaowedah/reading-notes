### Hash Tables
#### What is a Hashtable and Why do we use them?
Hash: the result of algorithm take string and convert it to value we use it to security, if we detrmine index of arrayو Buckets: contained in each index of the array of the hashtable ontain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs, Collisions: it happen when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable, we use it to hold unique value, Dictionary, Library.
#### What Are they
it is data structure it use value pairs every node and bucket have key and value, it have ability to store the key into this data structure and retrieve the value, by call hash it have the ability to encode the key it will map to specific location in data structure and we can look to retrieve the value, it is o(1) time because we can hash key and detrmine location and where value stores, but it will be o(n) if we have for loop to look through each piece of data one by one we through by all n, if we know the index of the information it will be o(1), it have the advantage of array o(1) because we can read access we can add element drom beginning or end, it take an key and return integer, this integer help us to determine the place in array, we use it to read something from hash map take key run through the hash code to get number to index the array.
#### Structure
hash code turns a key into an integer, the output is determined only by the input, The same key should always produce the same hash code, we can create a hash from an array and give it a size, urn that key into a numeric number value by: Add or multiply all the ASCII values together, Multiply it by a prime number, Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array, Insert into the array at that index, Each index of the array can hold many types of values, Each Index of the array contain buckets it holds key/value  When there is no entry in a specific bucket it will start null. The hash table starts bucket empty and overwrites their value once a key generates a hashCode.
#### Collisions
it happen when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array, the worst hash is hashes every single key to the same exact index of an array, keys you have hashed to a specific index, the more key/value pair, it happen when two different keys resolved to be the same index of the array, solved by changing the initial state of the buckets,initialize a LinkedList in each one, if we hace collision then the stored as a node in a linked list, we must store the entire key/value pair in the bucket, in hash map it do multi things to store value by: accept a key, calculate the hash of the key, use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
store the key with the value, and if we want to read a value by: accept a key, calculate the hash of the key, use modulus to convert the hash into an array index, use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket, search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value.
#### Internal Methods
- Add(): to add new key/value by: send the key to the GetHash method, determine the index of know the place, go to that index, Check if something exists, if it doesn’t, add it with the key/value,If something does exist, add the new key/value pair to the data structure within that bucket.
- Find():takes in a key, gets the Hash, and goes to the index location, see if the key exists and return the value.
- Contains():accept a key, and return a bool on if that key exists inside the hashtable. The best way to do this is to have the contains call the GetHash and check the hashtable if the key exists in the table given the index returned.
- GetHash():accept a key as a string, conduct the hash, and then return the index of the array where the key/value should be placed.
#### Basics of Hash Tables
it use to identify a specific object from a group of similar objects, like:unique roll number that can be used to retrieve information, have an object and you want to assign a key to it to make searching easy, store the key/value pair, you can use a simple array like a data structure where keys integers can be used directly as an index to store values, if the keys are large and cannot be used directly as an index, you should use hashing it will converted into small keys, the values are then stored in a data structure called hash table.
#### Hashing is implemented in two steps
element is converted into an integer by using a hash function: used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table, it will use as an index to store the original element, element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.
#### Hash function
used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table, The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes, requirement:Easy to compute, Uniform distribution, Less collisions.
