###  Redux - Additional Topics
####  Other ways to build and manage a Redux store
each developer have an internal pattern for putting it all together: File and Directory Names, Reducer and Action Styles, some project try to unify the community bt some standard ways to build store like:Redux Toolkit Batteries Included, Highly Opinionated framework for making stores, building a reducer and action set that work well together and are easier to understand and integrate, your store code can be as simple. 
####  Redux Toolkit (RTK)
package is like a standard way to write Redux logic, it come to solve three concerns: Configuring a Redux store is too complicated, I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful, Redux requires too much boilerplate code, and this package include: configureStore() It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, createReducer() ets you supply a lookup table of action types to case reducer functions, rather than writing switch statements, createAction() generates an action creator function for the given action type string. The function itself has toString() defined, so that it can be used in place of the type constant, createSlice() accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types, createAsyncThunk  accepts an action type string and a function that returns a promise, and generates a thunk that dispatches, createEntityAdapter generates a set of reusable reducers and selectors to manage normalized data in the store,  createSelector utility from the Reselect library, re-exported for ease of use.
####  MobX
is a simple, scalable and battle tested state management solution, makes state management simple by addressing the root issue Make sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived, will make sure that all changes to the application state caused by your actions are automatically processed by all derivations and reactions. Synchronously and glitch-free, tools can be used to analyze your mobx-react application: Visualizing re-rendering of components is now part of the standard React devtools, he dependency tree of a component tree can be inspected by showing the state of the useObserver hook in the React devtools, Spying on events can still be done with the browser plugin , through the mobx-logger package or manually by using the spy or trace utility from the mobx package.
####  HookState
Hookstate library API, you can install it by `npm install --save @hookstate/core`if you want to create global state by use createState. The first argument is the initial state value. The result value is an instance of State, which can be used directly to get and set the state value outside of a React component and use React.useState to create a local state, if you want to create a nested state data is a primitive value.
