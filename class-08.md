# Html
## Layout:
each element in html have it own box :this box will either be:
* Block-level Elements: *start on a new line*
* Inline Elements: *flow in between surrounding text*
* box may be nested inside several other block-level-elements,the containing elements is always the direct parent of the elements.
 ### Containing the position of Elements:
 * positioning schemes: 
   * Normal flow:Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down .
   * Relative Positioning
   * absolute positioning
   * fixed positioning
   * floating elements.
   *overlapping use z-index.
 * when you use positions you may need to use *box offset:* fixed,floatting elements.
 * position : *static, relative, absolute,fixed*
 * overlapping Element use `z-index`
 * learing Float : `clear` left, right, both, none.
 * we can use float to place elements side by side.
 


 the differant between screen size , screen resolution , page size we can do :
 * fixed width layout: stay in same width no matter.
 * Liquid layouts: layout will stretch t fil the screen.
