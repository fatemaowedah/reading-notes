#### answer the questions
- Why would a developer choose to make data models?In order to create a standardized way to store large amounts of data formatted in uncertain ways,helps us to define the relational tables, primary and foreign keys.

Create, Read, Update, Delete. These special functions place the actions onto rails so that they have to follow the defined structure of the data model.

- What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Mongoose is the package that MongoDB uses,it do the mange relations between data and delivery method between our application and our database. `node.js -> mongoose -> MongoDB`
- Describe how NoSQL Databases scale horizontally?adding more machines into your pool of resources, it devide the data in multi servers, it had a benifits it is cheap, better performance, Chances of downtime are less.
- Give one strong argument for and against NoSQL Databases? for: it work with large amount od data,it id quick, low cost, use to used and efficient but: donâ€™t have the reliability functions, not safe.
- Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department?For an apparel brand: Clothing, Accessories, and Hats. Clothing would be in a separate data pool than the other two. Accessories would be adjacent to Clothing. And Hats would fall under Accessories. Perhaps Accessories could fall under Clothing as well but in my head, they are different enough that they should be separate categories of item.
