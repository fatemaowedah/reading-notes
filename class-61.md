###  Redux - Combined Reducers
####  Combined Reducers
pulling in more than one reducer from source and creating a keyed object from them, any component can reach into the store and get either one, both, or all, Each reducer really should have only 1 part of state to manage, Each reducer technically has it’s own actions and creators, can cross over and both be dispatched, f an action of type ‘RESET’ is ever dispatched by any action creator, both of the reducers would actually respond, This can be` very powerful, as often times actions are valid for multiple reducers.
####  Redux Docs: Using Combined Reducers
Redux app is a plain Javascript object containing "slices" of domain-specific data at each top-level key, writing reducer logic for that state shape is to have "slice reducer" functions, each with the same (state, action), Multiple slice reducers can respond to the same action, independently update their own slice as needed, and the updated slices are combined into the new state object, Redux provides the `combineReducers` utility to implement that behavior higher-order reducer, which takes an object full of slice reducer functions, and returns a new reducer function, a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing Redux reducers, enforces several rules to help users avoid common errors, two ways to define the initial shape and contents of your store's state, the createStore function can take preloadedState as its second argument, oot reducer to return the initial state value when the state argument is undefined.
####  Redux Docs: Combined Reducer Syntax
want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state, combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore, can control state key names by using different keys for the reducers in the passed object, Arguments: reducers (Object): object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one, (Function): A reducer that invokes every reducer inside the reducers object, and constructs a state object with the same shape, Any reducer passed to combineReducers must satisfy these rules: any action that is not recognized, it must return the state given to it as the first argument, It must never return undefined, If the state given to it is undefined, it must return the initial state for this specific.
